    "# 2825. Make String a Subsequence Using Cyclic Increments\n",
    "**Level: Medium**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-string-a-subsequence-using-cyclic-increments/description/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In an operation, you select a set of indices in str1, and for each index i in the set, increment str1[i] to the next character cyclically. That is 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', and so on, and 'z' becomes 'a'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return true if it is possible to make str2 a subsequence of str1 by performing the operation at most once, and false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "Input: str1 = \"abc\", str2 = \"ad\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: true\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Select index 2 in str1.\n",
    "Increment str1[2] to become 'd'. \n",
    "Hence, str1 becomes \"abd\" and str2 is now a subsequence. Therefore, true is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "Input: str1 = \"zc\", str2 = \"ad\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: true\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Select indices 0 and 1 in str1. \n",
    "Increment str1[0] to become 'a'. \n",
    "Increment str1[1] to become 'd'. \n",
    "Hence, str1 becomes \"ad\" and str2 is now a subsequence. Therefore, true is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3\n",
    "Input: str1 = \"ab\", str2 = \"d\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: false\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: In this example, it can be shown that it is impossible to make str2 a subsequence of str1 using the operation at most once. \n",
    "Therefore, false is returned."
