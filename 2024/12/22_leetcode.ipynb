    "You are given a 0-indexed array heights of positive integers, where heights[i] represents the height of the ith building.\n",

    "\n",
    "Explanation: In the first query, Alice and Bob can move to building 2 since heights[0] < heights[2] and heights[1] < heights[2].\n",

    "In the second query, Alice and Bob can move to building 5 since heights[0] < heights[5] and heights[3] < heights[5]. \n",

    "In the third query, Alice cannot meet Bob since Alice cannot move to any other building.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the fifth query, Alice and Bob are already in the same building.  \n",
    "For ans[i] != -1, It can be shown that ans[i] is the leftmost building where Alice and Bob can meet.\n",
