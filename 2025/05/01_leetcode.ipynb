    "# 2071. Maximum Number of Tasks You Can Assign\n",
    "**Level: Hard**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-tasks-you-can-assign/description/)\n",
    "\n",
    "You have n tasks and m workers. Each task has a strength requirement stored in a 0-indexed integer array tasks, with the ith task requiring tasks[i] strength to complete. The strength of each worker is stored in a 0-indexed integer array workers, with the jth worker having workers[j] strength. Each worker can only be assigned to a single task and must have a strength greater than or equal to the task's strength requirement (i.e., workers[j] >= tasks[i]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you have pills magical pills that will increase a worker's strength by strength. You can decide which workers receive the magical pills, however, you may only give each worker at most one magical pill.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the 0-indexed integer arrays tasks and workers and the integers pills and strength, return the maximum number of tasks that can be completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "Input: tasks = [3,2,1], workers = [0,3,3], pills = 1, strength = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can assign the magical pill and tasks as follows:\n",
    "- Give the magical pill to worker 0.\n",
    "- Assign worker 0 to task 2 (0 + 1 >= 1)\n",
    "- Assign worker 1 to task 1 (3 >= 2)\n",
    "- Assign worker 2 to task 0 (3 >= 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2:\n",
    "Input: tasks = [5,4], workers = [0,0,0], pills = 1, strength = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can assign the magical pill and tasks as follows:\n",
    "- Give the magical pill to worker 0.\n",
    "- Assign worker 0 to task 0 (0 + 5 >= 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3:\n",
    "Input: tasks = [10,15,30], workers = [0,10,10,10,10], pills = 3, strength = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "We can assign the magical pills and tasks as follows:\n",
    "- Give the magical pill to worker 0 and worker 1.\n",
    "- Assign worker 0 to task 0 (0 + 10 >= 10)\n",
    "- Assign worker 1 to task 1 (10 + 10 >= 15)\n",
    "The last pill is not given because it will not make any worker strong enough for the last task.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints:\n",
    "- n == tasks.length\n",
    "- m == workers.length\n",
    "- $1 <= n, m <= 5 * 10^4$\n",
    "- 0 <= pills <= m\n",
    "- $0 <= tasks[i], workers[j], strength <= 10^9$"
